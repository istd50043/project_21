# Lab 2: SimpleDB Operators

### Due: Sunday 7/11 11:59PM


In this lab assignment, you will write a set of operators for SimpleDB to implement table modifications (e.g., insert
and delete records), selections, joins, and aggregates. These will build on top of the foundation that you wrote in Lab
1 to provide you with a database system that can perform simple queries over multiple tables.

Additionally, we ignored the issue of buffer pool management in Lab 1: we have not dealt with the problem that arises
when we reference more pages than we can fit in memory over the lifetime of the database. In Lab 2, you will design an
eviction policy to flush stale pages from the buffer pool.

You do not need to implement transactions or locking in this lab.

The remainder of this document gives some suggestions about how to start coding, describes a set of exercises to help
you work through the lab, and discusses how to hand in your code. This lab requires you to write a fair amount of code,
so we encourage you to **start early**!

## 1. Getting started

You should begin with the code you submitted for Lab 1 (if you did not
submit code for Lab 1, or your solution didn't work properly, contact us to
discuss options).  

### 1.1. Implementation hints

As before, we **strongly encourage** you to read through this entire document to get a feel for the high-level design of
SimpleDB before you write code.

We suggest exercises along this document to guide your implementation, but you may find that a different order makes
more sense for you. As before, we will grade your assignment by looking at your code and verifying that you have passed
the test for the ant targets `test` and
`systemtest`. Note the code only needs to pass the tests we indicate in this lab, not all of unit and system tests. See
Section 3 for a complete discussion of grading and list of the tests you will need to pass.

Here's a rough outline of one way you might proceed with your SimpleDB implementation; more details on the steps in this
outline, including exercises, are given in Section 2 below.

* Implement the operators `Filter` and `Join` and verify that their corresponding tests work. The Javadoc comments for
  these operators contain details about how they should work. We have given you implementations of
  `Project` and `OrderBy` which may help you understand how other operators work.

* Implement `IntegerAggregator` and `StringAggregator`. Here, you will write the logic that actually computes an
  aggregate over a particular field across multiple groups in a sequence of input tuples. Use integer division for
  computing the average, since SimpleDB only supports integers. StringAggegator only needs to support the COUNT
  aggregate, since the other operations do not make sense for strings.

* Implement the `Aggregate` operator. As with other operators, aggregates implement the `OpIterator` interface so that
  they can be placed in SimpleDB query plans. Note that the output of an `Aggregate` operator is an aggregate value of
  an entire group for each call to `next()`, and that the aggregate constructor takes the aggregation and grouping
  fields.

* Implement the methods related to tuple insertion, deletion, and page eviction in `BufferPool`. You do not need to
  worry about transactions at this point.

* Implement the `Insert` and `Delete` operators. Like all operators,  `Insert` and `Delete` implement
  `OpIterator`, accepting a stream of tuples to insert or delete and outputting a single tuple with an integer field
  that indicates the number of tuples inserted or deleted. These operators will need to call the appropriate methods
  in `BufferPool` that actually modify the pages on disk. Check that the tests for inserting and deleting tuples work
  properly.

Note that SimpleDB does not implement any kind of consistency or integrity checking, so it is possible to insert
duplicate records into a file and there is no way to enforce primary or foreign key constraints.

At this point you should be able to pass the tests in the ant
`systemtest` target, which is the goal of this lab.

Finally, you might notice that the iterators in this lab extend the
`Operator` class instead of implementing the OpIterator interface. Because the implementation of <tt>next</tt>/<tt>
hasNext</tt>
is often repetitive, annoying, and error-prone, `Operator`
implements this logic generically, and only requires that you implement a simpler <tt>fetchNext</tt>. Feel free to use
this style of implementation, or just implement the `OpIterator` interface if you prefer. To implement the OpIterator
interface, remove `extends Operator`
from iterator classes, and in its place put `implements OpIterator`.

## 2. SimpleDB Architecture and Implementation Guide

### 2.1. Filter and Join

Recall that SimpleDB OpIterator classes implement the operations of the relational algebra. You will now implement two
operators that will enable you to perform queries that are slightly more interesting than a table scan.

* *Filter*: This operator only returns tuples that satisfy a `Predicate` that is specified as part of its constructor.
  Hence, it filters out any tuples that do not match the predicate.

* *Join*: This operator joins tuples from its two children according to a `JoinPredicate` that is passed in as part of
  its constructor. We only require a simple nested loops join, but you may explore more interesting join
  implementations. Describe your implementation in your lab writeup.

**Exercise 1.**

Implement the skeleton methods in:

***  

* src/java/simpledb/execution/Predicate.java
* src/java/simpledb/execution/JoinPredicate.java
* src/java/simpledb/execution/Filter.java
* src/java/simpledb/execution/Join.java

***  

At this point, your code should pass the unit tests in PredicateTest, JoinPredicateTest, FilterTest, and JoinTest.
Furthermore, you should be able to pass the system tests FilterTest and JoinTest.

### 2.2. Aggregates

An additional SimpleDB operator implements basic SQL aggregates with a
`GROUP BY` clause. You should implement the five SQL aggregates
(`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`,
`MAX`) and support grouping. You only need to support aggregates over a single field, and grouping by a single field.

In order to calculate aggregates, we use an `Aggregator`
interface which merges a new tuple into the existing calculation of an aggregate. The `Aggregator` is told during
construction what operation it should use for aggregation. Subsequently, the client code should
call `Aggregator.mergeTupleIntoGroup()` for every tuple in the child iterator. After all tuples have been merged, the
client can retrieve a OpIterator of aggregation results. Each tuple in the result is a pair of the
form `(groupValue, aggregateValue)`, unless the value of the group by field was `Aggregator.NO_GROUPING`, in which case
the result is a single tuple of the form `(aggregateValue)`.

Note that this implementation requires space linear in the number of distinct groups. For the purposes of this lab, you
do not need to worry about the situation where the number of groups exceeds available memory.

**Exercise 2.**

Implement the skeleton methods in:

***  

* src/java/simpledb/execution/IntegerAggregator.java
* src/java/simpledb/execution/StringAggregator.java
* src/java/simpledb/execution/Aggregate.java

***  

At this point, your code should pass the unit tests IntegerAggregatorTest, StringAggregatorTest, and AggregateTest.
Furthermore, you should be able to pass the AggregateTest system test.

### 2.3. HeapFile Mutability

Now, we will begin to implement methods to support modifying tables. We begin at the level of individual pages and
files. There are two main sets of operations:  adding tuples and removing tuples.

**Removing tuples:** To remove a tuple, you will need to implement
`deleteTuple`. Tuples contain `RecordIDs` which allow you to find the page they reside on, so this should be as simple
as locating the page a tuple belongs to and modifying the headers of the page appropriately.

**Adding tuples:** The `insertTuple` method in
`HeapFile.java` is responsible for adding a tuple to a heap file. To add a new tuple to a HeapFile, you will have to
find a page with an empty slot. If no such pages exist in the HeapFile, you need to create a new page and append it to
the physical file on disk. You will need to ensure that the RecordID in the tuple is updated correctly.

**Exercise 3.**

Implement the remaining skeleton methods in:

***  

* src/java/simpledb/storage/HeapPage.java
* src/java/simpledb/storage/HeapFile.java<br>
  (Note that you do not necessarily need to implement writePage at this point).

***



To implement HeapPage, you will need to modify the header bitmap for methods such as <tt>insertTuple()</tt> and <tt>
deleteTuple()</tt>. You may find that the <tt>getNumEmptySlots()</tt> and <tt>isSlotUsed()</tt> methods we asked you to
implement in Lab 1 serve as useful abstractions. Note that there is a
<tt>markSlotUsed</tt> method provided as an abstraction to modify the filled or cleared status of a tuple in the page
header.

Note that it is important that the <tt>HeapFile.insertTuple()</tt>
and <tt>HeapFile.deleteTuple()</tt> methods access pages using the <tt>BufferPool.getPage()</tt> method; otherwise, your
implementation of transactions in the next lab will not work properly.

Implement the following skeleton methods in <tt>src/java/simpledb/storage/BufferPool.java</tt>:

***  

* insertTuple()
* deleteTuple()

***  


These methods should call the appropriate methods in the HeapFile that belong to the table being modified (this extra
level of indirection is needed to support other types of files &mdash; like indices &mdash; in the future).

At this point, your code should pass the unit tests in HeapPageWriteTest and HeapFileWriteTest, as well as
BufferPoolWriteTest.

### 2.4. Insertion and deletion

Now that you have written all of the HeapFile machinery to add and remove tuples, you will implement the `Insert`
and `Delete`
operators.

For plans that implement `insert` and `delete` queries, the top-most operator is a special `Insert` or `Delete`
operator that modifies the pages on disk. These operators return the number of affected tuples. This is implemented by
returning a single tuple with one integer field, containing the count.

* *Insert*: This operator adds the tuples it reads from its child operator to the `tableid` specified in its
  constructor. It should use the `BufferPool.insertTuple()` method to do this.

* *Delete*: This operator deletes the tuples it reads from its child operator from the `tableid` specified in its
  constructor. It should use the `BufferPool.deleteTuple()` method to do this.

**Exercise 4.**

Implement the skeleton methods in:

***  

* src/java/simpledb/execution/Insert.java
* src/java/simpledb/execution/Delete.java

***  

At this point, your code should pass the unit tests in InsertTest. We have not provided unit tests for `Delete`.
Furthermore, you should be able to pass the InsertTest and DeleteTest system tests.

### 2.5. Page eviction

In Lab 1, we did not correctly observe the limit on the maximum number of pages in the buffer pool defined by the
constructor argument `numPages`. Now, you will choose a page eviction policy and instrument any previous code that reads
or creates pages to implement your policy.

When more than <tt>numPages</tt> pages are in the buffer pool, one page should be evicted from the pool before the next
is loaded. The choice of eviction policy is up to you; it is not necessary to do something sophisticated. Describe your
policy in the lab writeup.

Notice that `BufferPool` asks you to implement a `flushAllPages()` method. This is not something you would ever need in
a real implementation of a buffer pool. However, we need this method for testing purposes. You should never call this
method from any real code.

Because of the way we have implemented ScanTest.cacheTest, you will need to ensure that your flushPage and flushAllPages
methods do no evict pages from the buffer pool to properly pass this test.

flushAllPages should call flushPage on all pages in the BufferPool, and flushPage should write any dirty page to disk
and mark it as not dirty, while leaving it in the BufferPool.

The only method which should remove page from the buffer pool is evictPage, which should call flushPage on any dirty
page it evicts.

**Exercise 5.**

Fill in the `flushPage()` method and additional helper methods to implement page eviction in:

***  

* src/java/simpledb/storage/BufferPool.java

***



If you did not implement `writePage()` in
<tt>HeapFile.java</tt> above, you will also need to do that here. Finally, you should also implement `discardPage()` to
remove a page from the buffer pool *without* flushing it to disk. We will not test `discardPage()`
in this lab, but it will be necessary for future labs.

At this point, your code should pass the EvictionTest system test.

Since we will not be checking for any particular eviction policy, this test works by creating a BufferPool with 16
pages (NOTE: while DEFAULT_PAGES is 50, we are initializing the BufferPool with less!), scanning a file with many more
than 16 pages, and seeing if the memory usage of the JVM increases by more than 5 MB. If you do not implement an
eviction policy correctly, you will not evict enough pages, and will go over the size limitation, thus failing the test.

You have now completed this lab. Good work!

### 2.6. Query walkthrough

The following code implements a simple join query between two tables, each consisting of three columns of integers.  (
The file
`some_data_file1.dat` and `some_data_file2.dat` are binary representation of the pages from this file). This code is
equivalent to the SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM some_data_file1,
     some_data_file2
WHERE some_data_file1.field1 = some_data_file2.field1
  AND some_data_file1.id > 1
```

For more extensive examples of query operations, you may find it helpful to browse the unit tests for joins, filters,
and aggregates.

```java
package simpledb;

import java.io.*;

public class jointest {

    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        // construct a 3-column table schema
        Type types[] = new Type[]{Type.INT_TYPE, Type.INT_TYPE, Type.INT_TYPE};
        String names[] = new String[]{"field0", "field1", "field2"};

        TupleDesc td = new TupleDesc(types, names);

        // create the tables, associate them with the data files
        // and tell the catalog about the schema  the tables.
        HeapFile table1 = new HeapFile(new File("some_data_file1.dat"), td);
        Database.getCatalog().addTable(table1, "t1");

        HeapFile table2 = new HeapFile(new File("some_data_file2.dat"), td);
        Database.getCatalog().addTable(table2, "t2");

        // construct the query: we use two SeqScans, which spoonfeed
        // tuples via iterators into join
        TransactionId tid = new TransactionId();

        SeqScan ss1 = new SeqScan(tid, table1.getId(), "t1");
        SeqScan ss2 = new SeqScan(tid, table2.getId(), "t2");

        // create a filter for the where condition
        Filter sf1 = new Filter(
                new Predicate(0,
                        Predicate.Op.GREATER_THAN, new IntField(1)), ss1);

        JoinPredicate p = new JoinPredicate(1, Predicate.Op.EQUALS, 1);
        Join j = new Join(p, sf1, ss2);

        // and run it
        try {
            j.open();
            while (j.hasNext()) {
                Tuple tup = j.next();
                System.out.println(tup);
            }
            j.close();
            Database.getBufferPool().transactionComplete(tid);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }

}
```

Both tables have three integer fields. To express this, we create a `TupleDesc` object and pass it an array of `Type`
objects indicating field types and `String` objects indicating field names. Once we have created this `TupleDesc`, we
initialize two `HeapFile` objects representing the tables. Once we have created the tables, we add them to the
Catalog. (If this were a database server that was already running, we would have this catalog information loaded; we
need to load this only for the purposes of this test).

Once we have finished initializing the database system, we create a query plan. Our plan consists of two `SeqScan`
operators that scan the tuples from each file on disk, connected to a `Filter`
operator on the first HeapFile, connected to a `Join` operator that joins the tuples in the tables according to the
`JoinPredicate`. In general, these operators are instantiated with references to the appropriate table (in the case of
SeqScan) or child operator (in the case of e.g., Join). The test program then repeatedly calls `next` on the `Join`
operator, which in turn pulls tuples from its children. As tuples are output from the
`Join`, they are printed out on the command line.

### 3.2. Grading

We will compile and run your code again **our** system test suite. These tests will be a superset of the
tests we have provided. Before handing in your code, you should make sure it produces no errors (passes all of
the tests) by running  <tt>ant runtest -Dtest=testname</tt> and <tt>ant runsystest -Dtest=testname</tt> on all of the tests whose name ('testname') appears in the text of this .md file and the .md file for the previous lab.
